Apex Triggers
Apex Triggers are pieces of code that automatically execute in response to specific events on Salesforce records, such as creation, update, or deletion. There are two types:

Before Triggers: Run before the record is saved, allowing for validation or modification.
After Triggers: Run after the record is saved, useful for actions that require the record ID, like sending notifications.
Apex Testing
Testing is essential in Apex development to ensure code quality and meet Salesforce's deployment requirements (at least 75% code coverage). Best practices include:

Using @isTest annotated classes for test methods.
Creating test data that mimics production data without affecting it.
Utilizing assertions to verify expected outcomes.
Asynchronous Apex
Asynchronous Apex allows long-running processes to execute in the background, improving performance. Key types include:

Future Methods: Execute operations asynchronously.
Batch Apex: Process large volumes of records in manageable chunks.
Queueable Apex: Offers flexibility for running jobs and chaining processes.
Apex Integration Services
Apex Integration Services enable Salesforce to communicate with external systems. This includes:

REST API: Expose Apex classes as RESTful services for external access.
SOAP API: Create SOAP-based web services for integration.
Callouts: Make HTTP requests to external APIs to retrieve or update data.
